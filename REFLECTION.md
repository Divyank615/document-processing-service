## Hardest Part

The hardest part of this assignment was implementing asynchronous document processing and managing background tasks correctly.
Handling the custom queue, updating document status, and ensuring the API remained responsive during processing required careful thinking.
Another challenge was configuring the testing setup using TypeScript, Jest, and Yarn, especially resolving tooling and dependency issues.

## What I Learned

Through this project, I learned how to design a backend service using clean architecture principles.
I gained a better understanding of separating concerns between controllers, services, repositories, and background workers.
This helped me improve my understanding of TypeScript, Express, and API design.

## Use of AI Tools

I used AI tools to understand best practices, debug errors, and validate my approach while building the system.
AI helped me with problem-solving, learning new concepts, and resolving configuration issues.

All final decisions, code structure, and implementations were done by me after reviewing and understanding the suggestions.

## Time Spent

- Understanding requirements and planning: ~1.5 hours
- API and architecture implementation: ~2 hours
- Asynchronous processing and queue logic: ~2 hours
- Testing setup and writing tests: ~1 hours
- Documentation (README and Reflection): ~1 hour

## Conclusion

This assignment helped me gain practical experience in building a backend service with asynchronous processing.
It strengthened my understanding of clean architecture, background jobs, and testing in a TypeScript-based backend application.
